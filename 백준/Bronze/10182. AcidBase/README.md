### 문제 설명

<p>There is no longer a STAAR test in chemistry—the pressure is off! You can just learn chemistry for the sheer fun of learning about the natural world (and to prepare for college)! Celebrating this fact, let’s do a program on acids, bases, and pH.</p>

<p>The pH of a solution is a measure of the ionization of water to form H<sup>+</sup>(acids) or OH<sup>-</sup>(bases).</p>

<p>There are four important variables (pH, pOH, H<sup>+</sup>, and OH<sup>-</sup>) and two important equations:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">pH = - log(H<sup>+</sup>)</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">pOH = - log(OH<sup>-</sup>)</p>

<p>Here the logs are logs base 10. The variables pH and pOH are also related by the equation:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">pH + pOH = 14</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line consists of the number of data sets. Each data set has either the H (representing H<sup>+</sup>) or OH (representing OH<sup>-</sup>) concentration.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Print out the pH rounded to the nearest hundredth.</p>
